# Colours
This mod expands the coloured blocks in the game.  
The game already has some variations of coloured blocks i.e. the planks, bricks and lanterns, what this mod does is it renames all these blocks to fit a "rainbow" of **21** colours (these colours can be seen below) however it keeps their id the same so your worlds wont have broken blocks in it, it also keeps the textures of those blocks the same so they do not effect the look of any build, the mod then adds new blocks with different colours to fill in the gaps to have a colour range for each block [this can be seen here](https://github.com/NACH0CHEE5E/CS-Mods/blob/master/Colours/Picture2.png). To acomodate for all these new blocks two new jobs and sciences have been added, the first of which is the paint mixer which makes the different colours that you then combine with blocks in either the existing dyers table or the new painters table. To make it a little bit more interesting and to break up the items so they are not all in one job blocks which would make more sense to be painted will be made in the painters table and ones which will be dyed will be made in the dyers table, both dye and paint can be made in the paint mixer using varies mixtures of other dyes and flowers.  
This mod was originaly going to be part of my [Blocks Mod](https://github.com/NACH0CHEE5E/CS-Mods/tree/master/Blocks) i would highly recomend that you play this mod with it, it adds many other blocks as well as more blocks to the coloured varients and makes the whole paint/dye system feel more "full".
