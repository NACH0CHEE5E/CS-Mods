# Placeable Water

This mod makes it so that the water bucket in the game will now place a dummy water block, this block acts like any normal block place it using the bucket pick it up like normal and youll get a water bucket back, it does not flow or anything you can use this to make decorations like water fountains

Note: The water blocks do not count as water meaning you can not use it fishers and stuff, the lighting at night seems to make the textures look a bit funky not quite sure why ill probs look into it at somepoint
