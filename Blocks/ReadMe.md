# Blocks
This mod expands the adds more blocks to the game.
This mod adds a vast amount of new blocks to the game to provide some more variation to your builds. There is also a new job and research for all the new blocks. This mod requires my [colours mod](https://github.com/NACH0CHEE5E/CS-Mods/tree/master/Colours), as it uses the colour system that it introduces to add more blocks to the game.
